============
 munin-html

DESCRIPTION
===========

munin-html is one of the munin master components run from the
:ref:`munin-cron` script.

This script is responsible for generating static HTML pages.

If "html_strategy cgi" is set in munin.conf, munin-html will assume
HTML pages are generated by munin-cgi-html, and exit silently.

OPTIONS
=======

munin-html has one significant option, which configuration file to
use.

Several other options are recognized and ignored as "compatibility
options", since :ref:`munin-cron` passes all options through to the
underlying components, of which munin-html is one.
